# First Day Demo

To introduce some of the objectives of the course, create a web page using an comp (image).

- Play down pixel-perfect design in favor of designing in the browser.
- Work with new flex and grid layout options rather than older hacks (we'll learn some of the fallback "hacks" though too).
- Working with typography, including [fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?selection.family=Montserrat)
